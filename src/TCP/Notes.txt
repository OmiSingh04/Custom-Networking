Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
When two nodes need a reliable connection, TCP is used to send the data back and forth between the users.
It guarantees that the data is sent from one end to the other and received in the same order as it was sent.

Point to point channels for applications that require reliable connections.

Definition: 
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-based protocol that provides a reliable flow of data between two computers.



PORT NUMBERS: Used to identify which application within the node should the data be sent!?
like from minecraft server to the client IP and the port!

SOCKETS
A SERVER RUNS ON THE PARTICULAR MACHINE ON A SOCKET BOUND TO A PORT NUMBER :)

On the client-side: The client knows the hostname of the machine on which the server is running and the port number on which the server is listening. 
To make a connection request, the client tries to rendezvous with the server on the server's machine and port. 
The client also needs to identify itself to the server so it binds to a local port number that it will use during this connection. 
This is usually assigned by the system.

If everything goes well, the server accepts the connection. 
Upon acceptance, the server gets a new socket bound to the same local port and also has its remote endpoint set to the address and port of the client. 
It needs a new socket so that it can continue to listen to the original socket for connection requests while tending to the needs of the connected client.


Definition: 
A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. 
A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.
