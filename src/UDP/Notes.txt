User Datagram protocol:
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a protocol that sends independent packets of data, called datagrams.
They are sent from one computer to another with no guarantees about arrival. UDP is not connection-based like TCP.

for example, a clock server that sends the current time to its client when requested to do so. If the client misses a packet, 
it doesn't really make sense to resend it because the time will be incorrect when the client receives it on the second try.'
If the client makes two requests and receives packets from the server out of order,
it doesn't really matter because the client can figure out that the packets are out of order and make another request.
